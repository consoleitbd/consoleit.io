        <p>&nbsp;</p>

        <p><strong><em>In Short:&nbsp;</em></strong><em>&nbsp;We are not responsible for the safety of any information
          that you share with third-party providers who advertise, but are not affiliated with, our Website.</em></p>

        <p>The App may contain advertisements from third parties that are not affiliated with us and which may link to
          other websites, online services or mobile applications. We cannot guarantee the safety and privacy of data you
          provide to any third parties. Any data collected by third parties is not covered by this privacy notice. We
          are not responsible for the content or privacy and security practices and policies of any third parties,

        <p>We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is necessary for the purposes set out in this
          privacy notice, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law (such as tax, accounting or
          other legal requirements). No purpose in this notice will require us keeping your personal information for
          longer than 90 days.</p>

        <p>When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete
          or anonymize such information, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has
          been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any
          further processing until deletion is possible.</p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>

        <p id='privacyrights'><strong>7. WHAT ARE YOUR PRIVACY RIGHTS?</strong></p>

        <p><strong><em>In Short:</em></strong><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;In some regions, such as the European Economic Area (EEA)
          and United Kingdom (UK), you have rights that allow you greater access to and control over your personal
          information. You may review, change, or terminate your account at any time.</em></p>

        <p>In some regions (like the EEA and UK), you have certain rights under applicable data protection laws. These
          may include the right (i) to request access and obtain a copy of your personal information, (ii) to request
          rectification or erasure; (iii) to restrict the processing of your personal information; and (iv) if
          applicable, to data portability. In certain circumstances, you may also have the right to object to the
          processing of your personal information. To make such a request, please use the <a href='#contact'>contact
            details</a> provided below. We will consider and act upon any request in accordance with applicable data
          protection laws.</p>

        <p>If we are relying on your consent to process your personal information, you have the right to withdraw your
          consent at any time. Please note however that this will not affect the lawfulness of the processing before its
          withdrawal, nor will it affect the processing of your personal information conducted in reliance on lawful
          processing grounds other than consent.</p>

        <p>If you are a resident in the EEA or UK and you believe we are unlawfully processing your personal
          information, you also have the right to complain to your local data protection supervisory authority. You can

        <p id='DNT'><strong>8. CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES</strong></p>

        <p>Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a Do-Not-Track ("DNT")
          feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your online
          browsing activities monitored and collected. At this stage no uniform technology standard for recognizing and
          implementing DNT signals has been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or
          any other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for
          online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice in a
          revised version of this privacy notice.&nbsp;</p>

          preceding calendar year. If you are a California resident and would like to make such a request, please submit

          data, please contact us using the contact information provided below, and include the email address associated
          with your account and a statement that you reside in California. We will make sure the data is not publicly
          displayed on the App, but please be aware that the data may not be completely or comprehensively removed from
          all our systems (e.g. backups, etc.).</p>
